user types a new note and submits it

the form's onsubmit function (written on page load):
- prevents page reload,
- makes a new note object using the <input> text and time
- pushes the new note to the local array & resets the form
- redraws the notes array
- sends the new note with an XHR request

browser -> server POST /new_note_spa (with new note payload)
server -> browser 201 CREATED {message: 'note created'}
